# Fetcher MCP

MCP server for fetch web page content using Playwright headless browser.

## Advantages

- **JavaScript Support**: Unlike traditional web scrapers, Fetcher MCP uses Playwright to execute JavaScript, making it capable of handling dynamic web content and modern web applications.

- **Intelligent Content Extraction**: Built-in Readability algorithm automatically extracts the main content from web pages, removing ads, navigation, and other non-essential elements.

- **Flexible Output Format**: Supports both HTML and Markdown output formats, making it easy to integrate with various downstream applications.

- **Parallel Processing**: The `fetch_urls` tool enables concurrent fetching of multiple URLs, significantly improving efficiency for batch operations.

- **Resource Optimization**: Automatically blocks unnecessary resources (images, stylesheets, fonts, media) to reduce bandwidth usage and improve performance.

- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging ensure reliable operation even when dealing with problematic web pages.

- **Configurable Parameters**: Fine-grained control over timeouts, content extraction, and output formatting to suit different use cases.

## Quick Start

Run directly with npx:

```bash
npx -y fetcher-mcp
```

First time setup - install the required browser by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

### Debug Mode

Run with the `--debug` option to show the browser window for debugging:

```bash
npx -y fetcher-mcp --debug
```

## Configuration MCP

Configure this MCP server in Claude Desktop:

On MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

On Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fetcher": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "fetcher-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Features

- `fetch_url` - Retrieve web page content from a specified URL
  - Uses Playwright headless browser to parse JavaScript
  - Supports intelligent extraction of main content and conversion to Markdown
  - Supports the following parameters:
    - `url`: The URL of the web page to fetch (required parameter)
    - `timeout`: Page loading timeout in milliseconds, default is 30000 (30 seconds)
    - `waitUntil`: Specifies when navigation is considered complete, options: 'load', 'domcontentloaded', 'networkidle', 'commit', default is 'load'
    - `extractContent`: Whether to intelligently extract the main content, default is true
    - `maxLength`: Maximum length of returned content (in characters), default is no limit
    - `returnHtml`: Whether to return HTML content instead of Markdown, default is false
    - `waitForNavigation`: Whether to wait for additional navigation after initial page load (useful for sites with anti-bot verification), default is false
    - `navigationTimeout`: Maximum time to wait for additional navigation in milliseconds, default is 10000 (10 seconds)
    - `disableMedia`: Whether to disable media resources (images, stylesheets, fonts, media), default is true
    - `debug`: Whether to enable debug mode (showing browser window), overrides the --debug command line flag if specified

- `fetch_urls` - Batch retrieve web page content from multiple URLs in parallel
  - Uses multi-tab parallel fetching for improved performance
  - Returns combined results with clear separation between webpages
  - Supports the following parameters:
    - `urls`: Array of URLs to fetch (required parameter)
    - Other parameters are the same as `fetch_url`

## Tips

### Handling Special Website Scenarios

#### Dealing with Anti-Crawler Mechanisms
- **Wait for Complete Loading**: For websites using CAPTCHA, redirects, or other verification mechanisms, include in your prompt:
  ```
  Please wait for the page to fully load
  ```
  This will use the `waitForNavigation: true` parameter.

- **Increase Timeout Duration**: For websites that load slowly:
  ```
  Please set the page loading timeout to 60 seconds
  ```
  This adjusts both `timeout` and `navigationTimeout` parameters accordingly.

#### Content Retrieval Adjustments
- **Preserve Original HTML Structure**: When content extraction might fail:
  ```
  Please preserve the original HTML content
  ```
  Sets `extractContent: false` and `returnHtml: true`.

- **Fetch Complete Page Content**: When extracted content is too limited:
  ```
  Please fetch the complete webpage content instead of just the main content
  ```
  Sets `extractContent: false`.

- **Return Content as HTML**: When HTML format is needed instead of default Markdown:
  ```
  Please return the content in HTML format
  ```
  Sets `returnHtml: true`.

### Debugging and Authentication

#### Enabling Debug Mode
- **Dynamic Debug Activation**: To display the browser window during a specific fetch operation:
  ```
  Please enable debug mode for this fetch operation
  ```
  This sets `debug: true` even if the server was started without the `--debug` flag.

#### Using Custom Cookies for Authentication
- **Manual Login**: To login using your own credentials:
  ```
  Please run in debug mode so I can manually log in to the website
  ```
  Sets `debug: true` or uses the `--debug` flag, keeping the browser window open for manual login.

- **Interacting with Debug Browser**: When debug mode is enabled:
  1. The browser window remains open
  2. You can manually log into the website using your credentials
  3. After login is complete, content will be fetched with your authenticated session

- **Enable Debug for Specific Requests**: Even if the server is already running, you can enable debug mode for a specific request:
  ```
  Please enable debug mode for this authentication step
  ```
  Sets `debug: true` for this specific request only, opening the browser window for manual login.

## Development

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Install Playwright Browser

Install the browsers needed for Playwright:

```bash
npm run install-browser
```

### Build the Server

npm run build
```

## Debugging

Use MCP Inspector for debugging:

```bash
npm run inspector
```

You can also enable visible browser mode for debugging:

```bash
node build/index.js --debug
```
